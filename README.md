<h3>Node Demonstration Application</h3>

This application demonstrates various aspects of NodeJS applications. 
The server uses <a href="http://www.embeddedjs.com/">EJS</a> for templating.
It explores routing, controllers and the use of require for modules. Basic web site 
functionality such as cookies and sessions are also demonstrated. Session 
persistence is via Mongodb.
Additionally, it demonstrates REST services with Node and Express, and
Websockets with socket.io.



This project is the source code for a node demonstration application. The
application is housed at  
<a href="http://donhenton-node.herokuapp.com/">http://donhenton-node.herokuapp.com/</a> .

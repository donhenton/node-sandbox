This application demonstrates various aspects of NodeJS applications. 
The server uses <a href="http://www.embeddedjs.com/">EJS</a> for templating.
It explores routing, controllers and the use of require for modules.
Additionally, it demonstrates REST services with Node and Express, and
Websockets with socket.io.
